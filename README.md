<p>This project contains a .cs file with many helpful classes and methods in order to communicate with Temple's Web Services</p>
```
Missing from this project (for obvious security reasons) are:
1)Links for web service calls that you will create 
NOTE:The Names for these web services are hardcoded in the TempleUser.cs page 
if you want them to say something else you will have to rename them
2)WSInfo class where you will store your username and password
```
